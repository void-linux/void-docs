# About

Welcome to the Void Handbook! Please be sure to read the "[About This
Handbook](./about-this-handbook.md)" section to learn how to use this
documentation effectively.

Void is an independent, [rolling
release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_release) Linux distribution,
developed from scratch rather than as a fork, with a focus on stability over
[bleeding-edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding_edge_technology). In
addition, there are several features that make Void unique:

- The [XBPS](https://github.com/void-linux/xbps) package manager, which is
   extremely fast, developed in-house, and performs checks when installing
   updates to ensure that libraries are not changed to incompatible versions
   which can break dependencies.
- The [musl libc](https://musl.libc.org/), which focuses on standards compliance
   and correctness, has first class support. This allows us to build certain
   components for musl systems statically, which would not be practical on glibc
   systems.
- The [LibreSSL](https://www.libressl.org/) fork is used instead of the mainline
   OpenSSL library. Developed as part of the OpenBSD project, LibreSSL is
   dedicated to the security, quality, and maintainability of this critical
   library.
- [runit](../config/services/index.md) is used for
   [init(8)](https://man.voidlinux.org/init.8) and service supervision. This
   allows Void to support musl as a second libc choice, which would not be
   possible with [systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/).
   A side effect of this decision is a core system with clean and efficient
   operation, and a small code base.

Void is developed in the spare time of a handful of developers, and is generally
considered stable enough for daily use. We do this for fun and hope that our
work will be useful to others.

The name "Void" comes from the C literal `void`. It was chosen rather randomly,
and has no deeper meaning.
