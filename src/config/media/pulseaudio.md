# PulseAudio

PulseAudio depends on a `dbus` system daemon, make sure its enabled.

```
# xbps-install -S alsa-utils pulseaudio
# ln -s /etc/sv/dbus /var/service/
```

The PulseAudio package comes with a services file, which is not necessary in
most setups and its
[discouraged](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/User/SystemWide/)
by the PulseAudio maintainers to use the system wide setup.

There are different methods that work with PulseAudio to allow access to the
audio devices, the simplest one is to just the `audio` group alternatively you
can use a session manager, like [elogind](#elogind) or
[ConsoleKit2](#consolekit2).
