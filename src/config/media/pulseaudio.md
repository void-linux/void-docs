# PulseAudio

Depending on which applications you use, you might need to provide PulseAudio
with a D-BUS session bus (e.g. via `dbus-run-session`) or a D-BUS system bus
(via the `dbus` service).

For applications which use ALSA directly and don't support PulseAudio, the
`alsa-plugins-pulseaudio` package can make them use PulseAudio through ALSA.

The PulseAudio package comes with a service file, which is not necessary in most
setups - the PulseAudio maintainers
[discourage](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/User/SystemWide/)
using a system-wide setup. Instead, PulseAudio will automatically start when
needed. If it is not starting automatically, it can be started manually by
invoking [pulseaudio(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/pulseaudio.1) from the
terminal as follows:

```
$ pulseaudio --daemonize=no --exit-idle-time=-1
```

There are several methods of allowing PulseAudio to access to audio devices. The
simplest one is to add your user to the `audio` group. Alternatively, you can
use a session manager, like `elogind`.
