# Package Documentation

The most common media for documentation in Void Linux are [manual
pages](./man.md).

Many packages contain documentation in other formats, like HTML. This
documentation can usually be found in a `/usr/share/doc/<package>` directory.

More extensive documentation may be split into separate `*-doc` packages, such
as `julia-doc`. This is often the case for programming languages, databases and
big software libraries.

In addition to documentation provided by upstream projects, packages may also
contain description of initial setup or usage specific to Void, provided by
distribution contributors. It will be located in
`/usr/share/doc/<package>/README.voidlinux`.
