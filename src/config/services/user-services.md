# Per user services

Sometimes it would be nice to have user-specific runit services. Services that,
for example, open an ssh tunnel as your current user, run a virtual machine, or
regularly run daemons on your behalf. The most common way to do this to ask a
system-level runsv daemon to start a runsvdir daemon as your user for your
personal service directory.

Create a service as `/etc/sv/$username/run` with the below contents:

```
#!/bin/sh

UID=$(pwd -P)
UID=${UID##*/}

if [ -d "/home/${UID}/service" ]; then
	chpst -u"${UID}" runsvdir /home/${UID}/service
fi
```

Then you can create runit services and symlink them under ${HOME}/service and
then runit will take care of starting and restarting those services for you.

One important caveat: if any services you have need group permissions instead of
just your user permissions, you will want to append those groups in a colon
separated list to your username, such as `/etc/sv/anon:void1:void2:void3/run`
instead of just `/etc/sv/anon/run`.
