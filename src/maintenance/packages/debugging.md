# Package debugging

Void Linux packages come without debugging symbols, if you want to debug
software or look at a coredump it is helpful to have the debugging symbols. To
get debugging symbols for packages you need to activate the debug repo,
afterwards its possible to install packages with the `-dbg` suffix.

```
$ xbps-install -S void-repo-debug
$ xbps-install -S <package name>-dbg
```

The `xtools` package contains the `xdbg` utility to retrieve a list of debug
packages including dependencies for a package.

```
$ xdbg bash
bash-dbg
glibc-dbg
# xbps-install -S $(xdbg bash)
```
