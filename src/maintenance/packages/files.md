# Finding files

To search a file in packages you can use one of two methods

The first method is to use
[xbps-query(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-query.1) which is okay to use if
you want to just look for local files, you can use it to search for remote files
with the `-R` flag but its very slow compared to the second method using
`xlocate`.

```
$ xbps-query -o /usr/bin/xlocate
xtools-0.46_1: /usr/bin/xlocate (regular file)
```

The `xtools` package contains the `xlocate` utility that works like
[locate(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/locate.1) but for all files in the void
package repository.

```
# xbps-install -Su xtools

$ xlocate -S From https://repo.voidlinux.org/xlocate/xlocate +
