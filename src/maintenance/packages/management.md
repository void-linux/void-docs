# General Package Management

Most general package management is done with the following commands:

- [xbps-query(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-query.1) displays information
   about packages installed locally, or, with the `-R` flag, packages contained
   in repositories.
- [xbps-install(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-install.1) installs and
   updates packages, and syncs repository indexes.
- [xbps-remove(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-remove.1) removes installed
   packages, and can remove cached package files.

Most questions can be answered by consulting the man pages for these tools. For
a more detailed overview of the X Binary Package System (XBPS), see the
documentation in the [xbps repository](https://github.com/void-linux/xbps).
