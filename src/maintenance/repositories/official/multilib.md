# multilib

The `multilib` repository provides 32-bit packages as a compatibility layer
inside a 64-bit system and is available through the package
`void-repo-multilib`.

These repositories are only available for `x86_64` systems running the `glibc` C
library.

# multilib/nonfree

The `multilib/nonfree` repository (available through the package
`void-repo-multilib-nonfree`) provides additional 32-bit packages which have
non-free licenses. See [nonfree](./nonfree.md) for more information about why
these packages are separated.
