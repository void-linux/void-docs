# Mirrors

Void Linux maintains mirrors in several geographic regions for users. A fresh
install will default to
[repo-default.voidlinux.org](https://repo-default.voidlinux.org), which may map
to any Tier 1 mirror, but you may have a better experience by [selecting a
different
mirror](https://docs.voidlinux.org/xbps/repositories/mirrors/changing.html).

> See [xmirror.voidlinux.org](https://xmirror.voidlinux.org) for more
> information and a list of available mirrors.

## Tor Mirrors

Void Linux is also mirrored on the Tor network. See [Using Tor
Mirrors](./tor.md) for more information.
