# Official Repositories

Void provides other official repositories, which are maintained by the Void
project, but not installed in the default configuration:

- [debug](./debug.md): contains debugging symbols for packages
- [multilib](./multilib.md): contains 32-bit libraries for 64-bit systems (glibc
   only)
- [multilib/nonfree](./multilib.md): contains non-free multilib packages
- [nonfree](./nonfree.md): contains software packages with non-free licenses

The next sections provide information on installing repositories, and summaries
of the different repositories offered.
