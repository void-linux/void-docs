# Installing Repositories

Void provides official [repositories](./index.md) that may be installed via a
package. For example, to install the `nonfree` repository, install the package
`void-repo-nonfree`:

```
# xbps-install -S void-repo-nonfree
```

These packages only install a repository configuration file in
`/usr/share/xbps.d`.
