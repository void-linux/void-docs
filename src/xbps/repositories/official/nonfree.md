# nonfree

Void has a `nonfree` repository for packages that don't have free licenses.
Install the `void-repo-nonfree` package to enable this repository.

Packages can end up in the `nonfree` repository for a number of reasons:

- Non-Free licensed software with released source-code.
- Software released only as redistributable binary packages.
- Patented technology, which may or may not have an (otherwise) open
   implementation.
